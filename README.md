## The `db` package

![Upper.io](https://github.com/ilovetravel/upperiodb/res/general.png)

`github.com/ilovetravel/upperiodb` is a [Go][2] package that allows developers to communicate
with different databases through the use of *adapters* that wrap well-supported
database drivers.

```
go get -u github.com/ilovetravel/upperiodb
```

## Is `db` an ORM?

`db` is not an ORM in the sense that it does not tell you how to design your
software or how to validate your data, instead it only focuses on being a tool
that deals with common operations on different databases:

```go
// This code works the same for all supported databases.
var people []Person

res = col.Find(db.Cond{"name": "Max"}).Limit(10).Sort("-last_name")

err = res.All(&people)
```

In strict sense `github.com/ilovetravel/upperiodb` could be considered a non-opinionated ORM that
rather stays out of the way.

## Supported databases

![Adapters](https://github.com/ilovetravel/upperiodb/res/adapters.png)

`github.com/ilovetravel/upperiodb` attempts to provide full compatiblity for [CRUD][2] operations
across adapters. Some other operations (such *transactions*) are supported only
on specific database adapters, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQLite.

* [MongoDB](https://github.com/ilovetravel/upperiodb/mongo) via [mgo](http://godoc.org/labix.org/v2/mgo)
